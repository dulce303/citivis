Creating Reality Hackathon USC MIT 2018
CITIVIS is a City Planning Engagement Tool to encourage CONVERSATION & COLLABORATION around key issues.

This is a hackathon work in progress that is in development as of March 2018. For more information contact isdale@gmail.com or lightlodges@gmail.com.

CITIVIS is a Civic Engagement Interactive Tool using Watson AI Tone Analyzer on speech and text to share basic feedback on the video stories to city planners.

This is a test for uses from journalism to education, team collaboration, work and simulating local solutions.

The 360 story, data, questions and information are designed to address key issues as LA plans its budgets to address homelessness in 2019.

The 360 Video Story in 3 Parts can be found at YouTube, including:

LAHSA Context Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxMmZ_HWLOc

LISA'S Story   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3CsxlMKnCA

REFRESH Spot  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxp7sRWdls

GOALS: As viewers interact with the videos in the City of LA build, data sets from the local agencies (LAHSA and LA City's Open Data Hub) can be layered into the interface to begin to match need areas, goals of citizens and local problem areas.

The CLOUDS above the city are designed to share keywords, semantic analysis, tone analysis and eventually sentiment during the deliberative process. Questions to answer can be added at the end of the experience to refine the feedback loop for city agencies or other decision makers to see generative feedback from local people.
